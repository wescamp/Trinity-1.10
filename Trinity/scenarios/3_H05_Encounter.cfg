        story= _ "As Haldrad's party headed back toward Weldyn, Dolevan's mind was racing. He had been in periodic contact with his brother Malevan for years, but he had not heard from him for over a year and a half. Malevan had been studying some powerful ancient culture, and had been trying to extract some of the lost knowledge and power. Because of the orc's words, Dolevan felt the red-eyed stranger was related to his brother's work."

        story= _ "The group had just emerged from the foothills and were gazing across the plains towards Weldyn when they heard a rumble and saw a black plume of smoke emerge from the city. Dolevan shrank back into the shadows, flipping though his papers to see if his brother's letters conatined anything relevant to the situation."
        background="story/landscape-bridge.jpg"
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "Dardrus froze in place when he saw the smoke emanating from the city.  
'I have seen this before...  What do you know of, uh, green-eyed traitors?'
'What are you talking about?,' answered Prince Haldrad.  Dolevan skimmed the letters for something about green eyes: nothing.
'The enemy is not strong, but is very devious.  They do not have bodies of their own, but they take control of vulnerable prey such as yourselves-'
'You know all of this from a black puff of smoke?,' interrupted the prince.
'No...  We fought against this enemy, it was a desperate battle to save the world - your people included.  We did not lose, but neither did we win.  The enemy is out there, and I've seen them responsible for such black plumes in the past.' " 
        background="story/landscape-bridge.jpg"
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "Dolevan searched for some mention of battles or war in his brother's letters. He found a speculation that humans had been enslaved by beings of great strength, and that the common enemy was the 'lower half'. He didn't know what 'lower half' meant, he suspected it was a bad translation by his brother, but this information suggested that Dardrus was not to be trusted."

    [part]
        story= _ "Prince Haldrad directed the group to head to Weldyn, in case they could provide assistance to the city defenders. They had gone a couple of miles before Haldrad realized Dolevan and his undead minions were no longer with them. He called out, but knew it was pointless for the Necromancer did not want to be with them..."
