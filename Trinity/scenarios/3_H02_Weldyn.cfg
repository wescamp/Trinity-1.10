    'So tell me, Dardrus, where do you come from?'
    'My home is near Carcyn.'
    'Right...  Why is it I have never seen a troll with hair before?  Are there many of you?'
    'I have no idea what a troll is, so I cannot answer your first question.  As to your second: no, there is only one of me.'
    Haldrad gave up.  He'd have more luck when the advisors were present."

        story= _ "Then the party heard the clanking and hoofbeats of the forces of Weldyn.  Queen Caldera had sent them when Haldrad was late and had sent no messenger explaining why.  Once they learned of the treachery by the people of Carcyn, they headed toward the town to punish the guilty.  This allowed Prince Haldrad and his party to continue back to Weldyn without further harrassment."
