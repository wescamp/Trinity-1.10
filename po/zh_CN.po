"leave out the part where Ishtu, great winged goddess of victory, and Athtep, "
"great red-eyed god of night, tear assunder that great storm which would "

"the destroyer was given to deathly Nura, who pushed it deep into the "
"shadows, from where it could never escape.  If it did escape, it could not "
"reclaim its heart, for golden-crowned Aruyun had breathed a mortal life into "
"the heart, and placed it upon this earth.  In this way, the gods ensured the "
"great destroyer could not proceed without eating its own heart!</i>"
